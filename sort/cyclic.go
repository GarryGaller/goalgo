	   Approach:
	   - Use the fact that we are given a range of 1-n, can try placing each number at
	     its correct index in the array, say 1 at 0, 2 at 1, 3 at 2 and so on.
	   - Iterate through the array and if the current number is not at the correct index,
	     swap it with the number at its correct index.

	   Cost:
	   - O(n) time, O(1) space.
